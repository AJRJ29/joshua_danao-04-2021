Good Day!
My name's Joshua Danao I'm a Jr. Software Engineer at Midwestern. 

We would like to request more information for the marketing site project.
We really need a couple photos and paragraphs in the "About Us" page for the content of our marketing site project.
It will be of immense help if you look into the matter at the earliest. 

We look forward to your communication. You can contact me at joshdanao29@gmail.com for any further clarifications.

Thanks and Regards,

## Code Test 

1. The mockup was made using Next.js, Javascript, CSS, HTML.
2. To solve the puzzle I had to combine 2 arrays of objects and remove the duplicates. 
3. I used the spread operator to combine the 2 arrays.
4. Then I used the reduce method to iterate through the array and grab each one of the objects one at a time. 
5. I also used the set method of map to get a key and value to be the initial value for the reduce method.
6. I used the set method because it has the ablity to delete any duplicates. 
7. Once I have a map with no duplicate names I used the values method of map to grab just the values. 
8. Then all I needed to do was convert the iterator into an array and so I used array.from method.
